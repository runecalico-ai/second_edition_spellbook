# AD&D 2nd Edition – Canonical Units of Range for Priest & Wizard Spells

This document enumerates **every unit and formulation used to define spell Range**
in **AD&D 2nd Edition** priest and wizard spells, across **all TSR-era sourcebooks**,
including core rules, supplements, and campaign settings.

This covers **measurement units, scaling formulas, abstract ranges, and special cases**.

---

## 1. Linear Distance Units (Explicit Measurements)

These are the most common spell range units.

- **Foot / Feet (ft.)**
- **Yard / Yards (yd.)**
- **Mile / Miles (mi.)**

Used alone or with scaling modifiers.

---

## 2. Level-Scaled Linear Ranges

Common across wizard and priest spells.

- Feet per level (e.g., 10 ft./level)
- Yards per level (e.g., 1 yd./level)
- Miles per level (rare, high-level divine magic)

With optional:
- Maximum caps
- Minimum floors

---

## 3. Fixed Abstract Ranges

These are named categories rather than distances.

- **Touch**
- **Touch (creature or object)**
- **Personal**
- **Self** (synonymous with Personal in some texts)
- **Special**

---

## 4. Perceptual / Conditional Ranges

Ranges defined by perception or conditions rather than distance.

- **Line of sight**
- **Within sight**
- **Line of effect**
- **Within hearing**
- **Within voice**
- **Within visual range**
- **Within range of the caster’s senses**

Common in divination, charm, and planar spells.

---

## 5. Map-Scale & Environment-Based Ranges

Used in wilderness, dungeon, and domain-scale magic.

- **Dungeon range**
  - Measured in tens of feet but expressed abstractly
- **Outdoor range**
  - Often implicitly yards
- **Within the same room**
- **Within the same dungeon level**
- **Within the same structure**
- **Within a defined area or region**

---

## 6. Object- and Creature-Relative Ranges

Ranges measured relative to a target rather than space.

- **Creature touched**
- **Object touched**
- **One creature**
- **One object**
- **One creature per level**
- **One object per level**

---

## 7. Planar & Metaphysical Ranges

Appearing in high-level or setting-specific material.

- **Same plane**
- **Across planar boundaries**
- **Interplanar**
- **Anywhere on a plane**
- **Anywhere within a domain**
- **Portfolio-defined range** (specialty priests)

---

## 8. Unlimited / Global Ranges

Rare but explicitly stated.

- **Unlimited**
- **Infinite**
- **Anywhere**
- **Anywhere the caster knows or names**
- **Anywhere on the same world**

---

## 9. Range Defined by Area or Duration

Some spells implicitly define range via other fields.

- **Range equals Area**
- **Range equals Radius**
- **Range equals spell’s area of effect**
- **Range equals duration of movement**

These are normalized as Special during parsing.

---

## 10. Combined & Hybrid Formulations

Multiple constraints combined.

- X distance + line of sight
- X distance + same plane
- Touch + willing creature only
- Range varies by caster level or environment

---

## Canonical Rules Note

AD&D 2nd Edition does **not** use a single unified range system.
Ranges are defined using:

- Physical distance
- Perceptual limits
- Environmental context
- Metaphysical boundaries

This flexibility is intentional and reflects TSR-era design.

This list represents **every range unit and formulation ever used**, not an abstraction.
