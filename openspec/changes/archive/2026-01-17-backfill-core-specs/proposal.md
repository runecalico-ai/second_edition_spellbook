# Change: Backfill Core Specifications

## Why
The project core capabilities (M0-M3) that are already implemented need to be formally documented in OpenSpec to provide a baseline for future changes and ensure consistent requirement tracking.

## What Changes
- Document existing project architecture and tech stack.
- Define requirements for core library management, importers, spellbook building, search, and vault (backup/restore).

## Impact
- Affected specs: architecture, library, importers, spellbooks, search, vault
- Affected code: all core application systems
